# 7- No Emails

Emails have been used in many occasions as a way to digitalize processes but it didn't really improve the processes in themselves. Instead of paper, you have emails and exactly the same problems:  
* no status of a request  
* no clear workflow  
* no specific support of the process by the tool  
* multiplex channel mixing all kind of information that needs to be demultiplexed  
* peer to peer exchanges limiting transparency.  

Basically, the actors stay in the way of the requestor creating unneeded friction that could hinder the ability to innovate.  
It's a pity because there are a lot of new tools that can replace most of the classical usage of emails:
* blog platforms: global or team level communication  
* service now or equivalent: ordering and many other workflows  
* chat: team or peer to peer messaging  
* meeting organizer apps  
* specialized object storage: document sharing  
* development tools: communications on features, bugs, code, design...  

All these tools offer advantages over emails and you may end up not having to use emails so much whenever you start using these tools. The only reason why emails are still so popular is the ubiquity and the level of adoption of emails. Everybody has an email address and mailers exist on any platforms.  

## What is the connection with DevOps?  
DevOps is a lot about removing frictions and establishing clear contracts between actors.  
This is exactly what the advantages of the tools replacing emails offer. So targeting not emails addresses the mindest shift required when moving to devops.
